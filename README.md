# Mailgun

Mailgun is an email automation service. It offers a complete cloud-based email service for sending, receiving and tracking email sent through your websites and applications. This component allows to connect Mailgun with Keboola platform, for sending automation.

To successfully operate the component, following parameters are required:

- a private API key for Mailgun,
- a Mailgun domain.

If you're unsure on where to find the API key, follow the steps mentioned in the [documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3goGqC9MEI) on how to obtain the API key. When it comes to Mailgun domains, upon registering each user is provisioned a sandbox domain. The sandbox domain can only send email to [**authorized recipients**](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/217531258-Authorized-Recipients). The limit is 5 authorized recipients per sandbox domain. It is therefore highly recommended to [register your own domain with Mailgun](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/202256730-How-do-I-pick-a-domain-name-for-my-Mailgun-account-) to not be limited by sandbox restrictions.

##### Pricing

Note that Mailgun is a paid service and is subject to [Mailgun's Terms Of Service](https://www.mailgun.com/terms/). By default, each domain can send up to 10 000 emails per month for free.
